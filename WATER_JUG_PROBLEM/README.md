## Water Jug Problem - Python Implementation

This project implements the Water Jug Problem using Python, where the goal is to measure a specific amount of water using two jugs of different capacities. The solution explores depth-first search (DFS) to find the possible steps required to solve the problem.

### Features:
- Input two jug capacities and a target amount.
- Uses DFS to find a valid sequence of steps.
- Outputs the step-by-step process of filling, emptying, and transferring water between jugs.

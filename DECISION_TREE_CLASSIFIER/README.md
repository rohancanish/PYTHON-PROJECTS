## Overview

The Decision Tree Classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. This project implements the classifier using the Scikit-Learn library and evaluates its performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohancanish/PYTHON-PROJECTS.git
   cd PYTHON-PROJECTS/DECISION_TREE_CLASSIFIER
   ```

2. Run the Python script to see the Decision Tree Classifier in action:

   ```bash
   python decision_tree_classifier.py
   ```

3. Review the output for model accuracy and evaluation metrics.

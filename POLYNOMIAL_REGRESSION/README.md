## Overview

Polynomial Regression is an extension of linear regression that allows for a non-linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. This project showcases how to fit a polynomial regression model to a dataset and visualize the results.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses a dataset.
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- Fits a polynomial regression model.
- Evaluates the model using metrics such as R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Visualizes the polynomial regression fit against the actual data points.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohancanish/PYTHON-PROJECTS.git
   cd PYTHON-PROJECTS/POLYNOMIAL_REGRESSION
   ```

2. Run the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook POLYNOMIAL_REGRESSION.ipynb
   ```

   This will open the Jupyter Notebook, where you can run the cells to execute the regression analysis and display the results.

## Results

The output will include key metrics like R², Mean Squared Error, and visualizations of the polynomial regression fit and residuals.

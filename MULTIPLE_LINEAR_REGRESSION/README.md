## Overview

Multiple Linear Regression is a statistical technique that models the relationship between two or more features and a continuous outcome variable. This project utilizes a dataset to predict outcomes based on multiple input variables, showcasing the application of linear regression techniques.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses a dataset.
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- Fits a multiple linear regression model.
- Evaluates the model using metrics such as R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and visualizations.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohancanish/PYTHON-PROJECTS.git
   cd PYTHON-PROJECTS/MULTIPLE_LINEAR_REGRESSION
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python multiple_linear_regression.py
   ```

   This will execute the regression analysis and display the results.

## Results

The output will include key metrics like R², Mean Squared Error, and visualizations of the regression line and residuals.
